The FactoryMethodDataProcessor class is designed to handle data processing operations, including sorting, using different sorting algorithms. It is a subclass of Object in the package ""MyPackage.""

The class has one instance variable, sortAlgorithmFactory, which holds an instance of the SortAlgorithmFactory class. This factory is responsible for creating instances of sorting algorithms.

The initialization method, initialize, initializes the FactoryMethodDataProcessor instance. It calls the initialize method of its superclass, Object, and creates a new instance of SortAlgorithmFactory, assigning it to the sortAlgorithmFactory variable.

The processData:withSortAlgorithm: method is responsible for processing a collection of data using a specified sorting algorithm. It takes two parameters: aCollection (the collection of data to be processed) and algorithmType (the type of sorting algorithm to use).

Within the method, a sorting algorithm instance is created using the sortAlgorithmFactory by calling the createSortAlgorithm: method and passing the algorithmType. The sortAlgorithm variable holds this instance.

Next, the sort: method is invoked on the sortAlgorithm instance, passing aCollection as the argument. The result of the sorting operation is stored in the sortedData variable.

Finally, the method returns the sortedData as the processed and sorted collection.

By utilizing the FactoryMethodDataProcessor class, clients can easily process and sort data by providing a collection and specifying the desired sorting algorithm. The FactoryMethodDataProcessor class abstracts the creation of sorting algorithms using the SortAlgorithmFactory, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.

In summary, the FactoryMethodDataProcessor class encapsulates data processing operations and provides flexibility in selecting and using different sorting algorithms for sorting collections of data.
