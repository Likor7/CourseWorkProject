The Food class inherits the behavior and attributes defined in its superclass, the Product class. It may have additional methods or attributes specific to food items, such as expiration date, nutritional information, or dietary restrictions.

As a subclass of Product, the Food class can be instantiated to represent individual food items available for purchase within the shopping application. It encapsulates relevant information about each food item, allowing for proper management, display, and transaction handling.

The Food class does not define any additional instance or class variables beyond what is inherited from its superclass. Its primary focus is on representing food products and their associated properties.

The Food class resides in the VisitorPattern package, which encompasses various components and patterns related to the Visitor Pattern and its application in the application's design.

Overall, the Food class represents a specific category of products, namely food items, within the Visitor Pattern. It extends the Product class to incorporate food-specific functionality, providing a structured representation of food items within the shopping application.
