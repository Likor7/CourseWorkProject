"
The PaymentSystem class is an abstract superclass that serves as the foundation for implementing payment system adapters in the context of the Adapter Pattern. It acts as a blueprint for creating specific adapter classes that integrate different payment systems into an application.

The PaymentSystem class does not define any instance variables or class variables explicitly. Its primary purpose is to provide a common interface and define a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.

By subclassing PaymentSystem and implementing the required methods, developers can create adapter classes tailored to specific payment systems, such as Stripe, PayPal, or others. These adapter classes act as intermediaries, enabling the application to communicate and interact with the corresponding payment system's API in a standardized and consistent manner.

The PaymentSystem class resides in the AdapterPattern package, which encompasses various components and patterns related to adapting and integrating external payment systems. It forms a fundamental part of the Adapter Pattern implementation, allowing developers to seamlessly incorporate different payment systems into their applications without tightly coupling the code to specific payment system APIs.

Overall, the PaymentSystem class provides an abstraction layer and a common interface for implementing payment system adapters. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and flexibility, enabling developers to integrate different payment systems into their applications using a unified approach.
