The AdapterPaymentProcessor class is a subclass of Object that serves as an adapter for integrating different payment systems into the application. It encapsulates a specific payment system object and adapts its functionality to the standardized interface expected by the application.

Instance Variables:

    paymentSystem: Represents the payment system object that is being adapted by the adapter.

The AdapterPaymentProcessor class acts as an intermediary between the application and the specific payment system being integrated. It adapts the methods and behavior of the payment system to conform to a common interface, allowing the application to interact with different payment systems using a unified approach.

By encapsulating the payment system object within the AdapterPaymentProcessor class, it shields the application from direct dependencies on the specific details of each payment system's API. This abstraction layer promotes code modularity, flexibility, and reusability, as the application can easily switch or add new payment systems without making extensive changes to the codebase.

The AdapterPaymentProcessor class does not define any class variables. Its primary focus is on adapting the functionality of the underlying payment system and providing a consistent interface for the application.

The AdapterPaymentProcessor class resides in the AdapterPattern package, which encompasses various components and patterns related to adapting and integrating external payment systems. It plays a crucial role in facilitating the integration of different payment systems into the application, ensuring seamless communication and interaction.

Overall, the AdapterPaymentProcessor class acts as a vital adapter, bridging the gap between the application and specific payment system objects. It adapts the functionality of the payment system to conform to a standardized interface, enabling the application to interact with different payment systems using a unified approach.
