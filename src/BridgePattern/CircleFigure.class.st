The CircleFigure class is a subclass of the AbstractFigure class. It represents a specific type of figure, namely a circle, within the context of the Bridge Pattern.

The CircleFigure class inherits the drawingMethod instance variable from its superclass, AbstractFigure. This variable holds a reference to a DrawingMethod object, which defines the specific drawing method used to render the circle.

As a subclass of AbstractFigure, the CircleFigure class can extend and implement its own functionality specific to circles while leveraging the bridge pattern to connect the circle figure with the appropriate drawing method.

The CircleFigure class does not define any additional instance or class variables beyond what is inherited from its superclass. Its primary focus is on implementing the specific behavior and characteristics of a circle figure.

The CircleFigure class resides in the BridgePattern package, which encompasses various components and patterns related to the Bridge Pattern and its application in the application's design.

Overall, the CircleFigure class represents a specific type of figure, a circle, within the Bridge Pattern. It extends the AbstractFigure class, providing its own implementation for circle-related functionality while utilizing the bridge pattern to connect with the appropriate drawing method specified by the drawingMethod instance variable
